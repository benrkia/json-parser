JSON parser, maybe a little more, implemented in several programming languages.

**[JSON](http://www.JSON.org/)** is a light-weight, language independent, domain specific language _data-interchange language_.

## Motivation

I was always amazed by the fact that computers, on a lower level, translate all the things we do--from web browsing, gaming, streaming--to a large set of _zeros_ and _ones_. Being a programmer since a young age helped me to understand how these cool apps we use on a daily basis actually work. Still, it's a much higher level of abstraction.

Unsurprisingly, I grew interested in compiler engineering and language theory. Before start working on my toy programming language--during the quarantine-- i decided to implement a JSON parser by only reading the grammar and no considerable prior knowledge about lexers nor parsers.

8 months after, while i was watching [Lex Fridman Podcast | Brian Kernighan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9upVbGSBFo&t=3717s) I was thinking of a strategy to learn more programming languages--for fun, but most importantly to learn more about disciplines regarding compiler engineering. From this point, i decided to implement a JSON parser, maybe more than that, in a variety of programming languages.

## Challenge

Currently, i'm working as a full stack engineer so this is just a _side hustle_. Nonetheless, I challenge myself to do it in at least 10 programming languages, i.e. a rate of 1 language/month + a margin.

If I had enough time I would gladly blog my journey, maybe an article about each implementation, patterns I learned or just some tips and practices.

### TODO

The order may change over time.

  > Functional
  3. [ ] Haskell

  > Procedural
  1. [ ] C
  2. [ ] Go

  > OOP
  4. [ ] Smaltalk
  5. [ ] C++ (not really an oop language)
  6. [ ] C#

  > Multi Paradigm
  7. [ ] Scala
  9. [ ] Rust
  10. [ ] Julia
  8. [ ] Swift
